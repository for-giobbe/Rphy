### Modelling Trait Evolution


---


### intro: 


Before starting this practical set the appropriate working directory and load the necessary libraries in R:


Libraries:


- [ape](https://emmanuelparadis.github.io/)
- [phytools](http://www.phytools.org/)
- [geiger](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geiger/index.html)


```
setwd("~/Desktop/RPHY/")
library(ape)
library(phytools)
library(geiger)
```


There are no better words than those from [Luke Harmon](https://lukejharmon.github.io/) 
to kickstart this lesson:


>Comparative methods combine biology, mathematics,
>and computer science to learn about a wide variety of topics in evolution using
>phylogenetic trees and other associated data. For example, we can find out which processes must have been
>common, and which rare, across clades in the tree of life; whether evolution
>has proceeded differently in some lineages compared to others; and whether the
>evolutionary potential that we see playing out in real time is sufficient to explain
>the diversity of life on earth, or whether we might need additional processes that
>may come into play only very rarely or over very long timescales,

### inferring a discrete trait ASR: do Octopodiformes come from the bottom of the ocean?


As always in phylogenetic comparative methods, two fundamental components are required:

 
- a phylogeny - but ultrametric tree is much better
- either discrete or continuous trait(s) 


Here we will leverage a [Octopodiformes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopodiformes) phylogeny and a discrete classification of the maximum depth
at which they have been observed:


- P - pelagic 
- E - euphotic, up to 100 meters in depth
- D1 - disphotic 1, up to 400 meters in depth
- D2 - disphotic 2, up to 400 meters in depth
- N - no-photic, more than 800 meters in depth


Let's start by importing the tree and the data:


```
tree <- read.tree("trees/tree_octopodiformes.nwk")
tree <- force.ultrametric(tree,"extend")
data <- read.table("traits/traits_octopodiformes.csv", sep = ",", row.names = 1, header = T)
data <- setNames(as.factor(data[,"discrete"]),rownames(data))
```


Then, as seen in other instances, we have to find an model appropriate for our data.
Also here, the central component is a rates matrix, not dissimilar from
the Q matrix we have seen for amino acids / nucleotides models.
Let's fit three models to the data, which are:


- a timetree 
- character states


The three models are:

- ER - Equal Rates
- SYM - SYMmetrical
- ARD - All Rates Different


```
ER <- fitDiscrete(tree, data, model="ER")
SYM <- fitDiscrete(tree,data,model="SYM")
ARD <- fitDiscrete(tree,data,model="ARD")
```




Here is a graphical visualisation of the models.

![alt text](https://github.com/for-giobbe/Rphy/blob/main/figures/Figure_5.3.png)




Then we will asses how good their fit is, using 
[Akaike weights](https://brianomeara.info/aic.html) - the smaller the better!


```
aicc<-setNames(c(ER$opt$aicc,
                 ARD$opt$aicc,
                 SYM$opt$aicc),
               c("Equal Rates",
                 "All Rates Different",
                 "Symmetrical"))
aicw(aicc)
```


We can see that ARD is the better fit!


```
                         fit     delta            w
Equal Rates         123.9865  0.000000 9.893373e-01
All Rates Different 180.3405 56.354017 5.730930e-13
Symmetrical         133.0470  9.060562 1.066273e-02
```


Then we can use the best-fit model to perform the ancestral state reconstruction
and visualise it:


```
fitARD<-ace(data,tree,model="ARD",type="discrete")
plot.phylo(tree,lwd=7.5, edge.width = 7.5, label.offset = .2,show.tip.label = T,no.margin = TRUE, 
           edge.color = "lightgray")
nodelabels(node=1:tree$Nnode+Ntip(tree),pie=fitARD$lik.anc,cex=0.42, piecol = cols)
tiplabels(pie=to.matrix(data[tree$tip.label],levels(data)),cex=0.42, piecol = cols)
add.simmap.legend(colors = cols)
```

So ... do Octopodiformes come from the photic zone ... or they originated deep down 
in the sea where the light is extremely scarce?

### inferring a continuous trait ASR: what was the ancestral AT content in Enterobacterales?


The Enterobacterales order of Gammaproteobacteria is a bacteria Order which includes some 
notable species such as E. coli or Y. pestis. They have a huge disparity in lifestyles, 
including several independent shifts to endosymbiosis. In order to infer how their AT content 
maps across their phylogeny, we need to attain a ultrametric tree from a ML one. We will do 
that using the Penalised Likelihood Approach of [chronos](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ape/versions/5.8/topics/chronos) function.
Remember the difference between:


- a tree that has branch lengths that correspond to the amount of change that has happened on each tip and edge
- a tree one in which the distances from the root to every branch tip are equal
- a tree were branch lengths are proportional to time


 To speed up things I arbitrary chose 

- a relaxed clock model to account for heterogeneity among branches.
- three as lambda that when increased smooths the variation in the rates and tend to a strick clock model (same rate for all branches)


Subsequently we remove possible ploitomies using the multi2di function.


```
tree <- read.tree("tree_enterobacterales.nwk")
tree <- root(tree_simp,c("NZ-CP009610","NZ-CP028926","NZ-CP050969"))
tree <- chronos(tree, model = "relaxed", lambda = 3)
tree <- multi2di(tree)
```


We import the trait states:


```
data<-read.csv("traits_enterobacterales.csv",row.names=1)
AT_content<-setNames(as.numeric(data[,"mean_CDS_at"]),rownames(data))
```


We then perform the ASR of Enterobacterales AT content, which is a continuous trait. Here, to speed up things
we are skipping model selection and assuming a [Brownian Motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion), 
yet it is indeed important also when talking about continuous states. Some continuous traits' models include:


- BM - Brownian Motion (BM)
- EB/AC - Early Burst 
- LB/DC - Late Burst 
- OU - Ornstein-Uhlenbeck 
- Trend - BM with a trend 


We can infer and plot the ancestral trait state:


```
fit<-fastAnc(tree, AT_content,vars=TRUE,CI=TRUE)
simp_ASR<-contMap(tree,AT_content,plot=FALSE)
plot(simp_ASR, ftype="off", type="fan")
```


![alt text](https://github.com/for-giobbe/Rphy/blob/main/figures/Figure_5.5.png)


Some times ASRs are not much informative ...

### is there a correlation between AT content and the number of genes in Enterobacterales?

Species' traits covary because they share (some) evolutionary history: we expect closely related species 
to be more similar to each other than more distantly related species. 
Treating species as independent in statistical analyses can be misleading! Let see a practical example:
is there a correlation between AT content and the number of genes in Enterobacterales?


Let’s just act as all datapoints (species) are unrelated:

```
fit<-lm(data$mean_CDS_at~data$mean_CDS_ln)
summary(fit)
```


We see that the correlation is significant ... 

```
Call:
lm(formula = data$mean_CDS_at ~ data$mean_CDS_ln)

Residuals:
    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
-14.947  -9.009  -4.443   7.564  23.845 

Coefficients:
                  Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
(Intercept)      34.079510   7.370279   4.624 6.61e-06 ***
data$mean_CDS_ln  0.021855   0.007926   2.757  0.00635 ** 
---
Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1

Residual standard error: 11.12 on 208 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.03526,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.03062 
F-statistic: 7.603 on 1 and 208 DF,  p-value: 0.006347
```


But we should instead act as the species considered 
share part of their evolutionary history! The common way to incorporate this
piece of indformation into analyses is the 
Phylogenetic Independent Contrasts (PIC). This method for accounting for phylogenetic relatedness 
when making interspecific trait comparisons. 
Now let’s see if by using Felsenstein’s (1985!) algorithm we can test this type I error.


```
mean_CDS_at_PIC<-pic(data$mean_CDS_at,tree)
mean_CDS_ln_PIC<-pic(data$mean_CDS_ln,tree)
fit.pic<-lm(mean_CDS_at_PIC~mean_CDS_ln_PIC)
summary(fit.pic)
```


And the significance is gone ... 


```
Call:
lm(formula = mean_CDS_at_PIC ~ mean_CDS_ln_PIC)

Residuals:
    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
-88.931  -7.811   1.840   9.318 113.126 

Coefficients:
                 Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)
(Intercept)     -2.392486   1.603823  -1.492    0.137
mean_CDS_ln_PIC  0.005969   0.007423   0.804    0.422

Residual standard error: 23.17 on 207 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.003114,	Adjusted R-squared:  -0.001702 
F-statistic: 0.6466 on 1 and 207 DF,  p-value: 0.4223
```


The relationship that we retrieved without PIC is a type I error driven by the phylogenetic structure of our data. 
Type II errors are possible as well!

### a proof of concept on simulated data:

Let's simulate a tree! Everybody should change a bit these numbers

- the random seed (set to 42)
- the number of tips (set to 100)
- the birth rate (set to 1.0)
- the death rate (set to 0.6)
- include only extant - and not extinct - species (set to TRUE)


```
set.seed(42)
tree<-NULL
while(is.null(tree)) 
  tree<-pbtree(n=100,b=1,d=0.6,extant.only=T)
plotTree(tree,ftype="off")
```


Then we can simulate uncorrelated (Brownian) evolution:

```
x <- fastBM(tree)
y <- fastBM(tree)
```


and then plot the resulting trees! 


```
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
obj <- contMap(tree,x,plot=T, ftype="off", lwd=5, outline = FALSE)
obj <- contMap(tree,y,plot=T, ftype="off", lwd=5, outline = FALSE)
```

Now, I want you to perform a linear regression on the two traits, either: 


- entirely disregarding the species phylogeny
- considering species shared evolutionary history 


... we need to take the phylogeny into account ...

### apply what you have learned in a real-case scenario: can complex traits revert after their loss!?


Dollo’s law of irreversibility (also known as Dollo’s law and Dollo’s principle), 
proposed in 1893 by Belgian paleontologist Louis Dollo states that 
“an organism never returns exactly to a former state, 
even if it finds itself placed in conditions of existence identical 
to those in which it has previously lived … it always keeps some trace of the intermediate stages 
through which it has passed.” 
The statement is often misinterpreted as claiming that evolution is not reversible, 
or that lost structures and organs cannot reappear in the same form.

In 2003 a paper published in Nature by Whiting et al. suggested that wings may have reappeared 
several times within the ancestrally wingless phasmid, possibly on many occasions. 
We have inferred a comprehensive phylogeny of Phasmatodea and coded presence and absence of wings 
(as binary states: 2=absence and 1=presence). Missing data are coded as NA!


Here is the code for the hardest part ... importing the data ...

```
tree<-read.tree("trees/tree_phasmatodea.nwk")
data<-read.csv("traits/traits_phasmatodea.csv",row.names=1)
chk<-name.check(tree,data)
tree.pruned<-drop.tip(tree,chk$tree_not_data)
data.pruned<-data[!(rownames(data)%in%chk$data_not_tree),,drop=FALSE]
wings<-setNames(as.factor(data.pruned[,"wings"]),rownames(data.pruned))
```


Then I want you to try answer two questions ... 

- was the MRCA of stick insect winged?!
- is it possible to reinstate wings after their loss?
